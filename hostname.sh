# Change hostname
#

# NOTE: A quote from RFC 1178 - Choosing a Name for Your Computer:
#       "Don't expect case to be preserved.
#
#        Upper and lowercase characters look the same to a great deal of internet software,
#        often under the assumption that it is doing you a favor. It may seem appropriate
#        to capitalize a name the same way you might do it in English, but convention 
#        dictates that computer names appear all lowercase. (And it saves holding down the
#        shift key.)" [1]
#
# NOTE: "The Internet standards (Requests for Comments) for protocols specify that labels
#        may contain only the ASCII letters a through z (in a case-insensitive manner),
#        the digits 0 through 9, and the hyphen-minus character ('-'). The original
#        specification of hostnames in RFC 952 disallowed labels from starting with a digit
#        or with a hyphen character, and could not end with a hyphen. However, a subsequent
#        specification (RFC 1123) permitted hostname labels to start with digits. No other
#        symbols, punctuation characters, or white space are permitted. Internationalized
#        domain names are stored in the Domain Name System as ASCII strings using Punycode
#        transcription." [2]
#
# NOTE: "Ensures that each segment
#        - Contains at least one character and a maximum of 63 characters
#        - Consists only of allowed characters: letters (A-Z and a-z),
#          digits (0-9), and hyphen (-)
#        - Ensures that the final segment (representing the top level domain
#          name) contains at least one non-numeric character
#        - Does not begin or end with a hyphen
#        - maximum total length of 253 characters
#        For more details , please see: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035,
#        https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1912, and
