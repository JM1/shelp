+#    > prevents errors in case a removable device like usb device has been removed
+#
+#  -n standby,q 
+#    > only test disks if they are not in standby or sleep mode (prevents spinning)
+#
+#  -H 
+#    > test health status of disks
+#
+#  -s S/../(1|15)/./15 
+#    > do a short test at every 1st and 15th day of a month at 15:00 o'clock
+#
+#  -m root
+#    > send warning mails to root
+#
+#  -M daily 
+#    > send mails every day in case of an error 
+#
+#  -f 
+#    > test SMART values for errors
+#
+#  -t 
+#    > enables '-p' and '-u' which causes smartd to tracks changes in all device attributes
+#
+#  -I 194

+#    > Do not show normalized temperature (in range 1 - 255) but the real value (e.g. 22째C)

+#    > Track temperature changes larger than 5째C, log temperatures > 40째C and send warnings > 45째C
+# 
+#  -R 5 
+#    > Track changes to raw value (non-normalized value / not in range 1-255) of Reallocated_Sector_Ct, 
+#    > which might be much bigger than 255, so small changes would not be noticed with normalized values.
